title: Hi, I'm Matt Sly

I live in Boston by way of Oakland (and Williamstown, San Francisco, Philadelphia, New Haven and Providence). I enjoy making software, playing sports, hanging out with my family (#girldad x 2!) and exploring the outdoors.

I've worked at Microsoft (Bing, XBox), Amazon (Alexa) and as an executive at several Boston-area venture-backed startups: ([EverTrue](https://www.evertrue.com/), [Upserve](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/upserve/) and [BetterLesson](https://betterlesson.com/)).

I also created [FutureMe](https://www.futureme.org) (with my friend Jay) way back in 2002...and then ran it as a "side-hustle" as it grew into a global business with millions of users. FutureMe has been featured in many publications (New York Times, Wired, CNN, LA Times, Oprah(!)...) but my favorite bit of press is [an interview that I did with Scott Simon on Weekend Edition](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9261640). 

I [sold FutureMe in 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6877285007862333441/).

I recently built [The Parent Bank](https://www.theparentbank) because I decided that [the piggy bank is due for an upgrade](https://www.theparentbank.com/blog/posts/five-problems-with-a-piggy-bank) because it doesn't teach kids about how saving also means earning. I wanted to be able to (among other things) [pay my kids a really high interest rate](https://www.theparentbank.com/blog/posts/you-should-pay-your-kids-a-really-high-interest-rate-on-their-savings-here-s-why-and-how) and teach them about the wonders of compounding.

I used to be a [pretty decent basketball player](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4noKg75z7k4vXJag8) even though my shorts were too small. I also [coached high school basketball](https://photos.app.goo.gl/PPsTF9LEoRRYw2TK8) and took a small charter school without a gym [deep into the state play-offs](https://www.sfgate.com/preps/article/Gateway-beats-long-odds-to-reach-NorCal-playoffs-2812135.php). Now I'm way over the hill, but I still enjoy playing hoops, as well as tennis, soccer and cycling. Also you should ["shoot the two" when playing "winner's outs" half-court hoops](https://medium.com/@mattsly/shoot-the-two-ed4aaa553294).

I went to [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/), where I "played" (um, sat on the bench) on a [really good basketball team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dAKpFzVJqs&ab_channel=WilliamsEphsSports) that twice went to the Division III Final Four. I also sang in [The Springstreeters](https://linktr.ee/springstreeters?fbclid=IwAR1ixdaJL-L5-wn0y2HQ8KVnlCNzN5RnJuStgQPA7sYYdZIlIhyYceb5rkc) with [some famous people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZhzwtEcHU&ab_channel=TIFFTrailers), and [crashed the college servers]({% post_url 2009-07-25-dancing-baby-life-imitating-art %}) when my first ever web-site featuring [The Dancing Baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_baby) went viral.
