    <p>Back in college, I wrote little MP3 player that was mashed up with that OG Internet Meme - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_baby">The Dancing Baby</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/famous-dancing-baby-animated.gif" alt="Dancing Baby" /></p>

<p>“The Dancing Baby Jukebox” was a simple web page on my college site (/~msly - remember those tildas?!) that embedded a shockwave player (remember Macromedia?!) and let you pick a song to have the baby dance to. The most popular was James Brown’s “Sex Machine.” (Of note: this was before the big napster controversy and I didn’t even realize what I was doing wasn’t exactly legal and I never got a smackdown from the RIAA…)</p>

<p>The project went a bit viral (I have no idea how!) and ended up being featured in the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/mirapaul/072497mirapaul.html">New York Times</a> and on NPR and even in the Getty Musuem and the ensuing traffic crashed the college servers. My bad!</p>

<p>Here’s the college <a href="/assets/DancingBaby-SlyPressRelease.pdf">press release that is so old school that I had to scan it as a PDF</a></p>

<p>Fast forward ten years and indeed it turns out that life imitates art. Here is a video of my daughter when she was 10 months old:</p>
