<p>I live in Boston by way of Oakland (and Williamstown, San Francisco, Philadelphia, New Haven and Providence) and enjoy making software, playing sports, hanging out with my family and exploring the outdoors.</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://www.futureme.org">FutureMe</a> (with my friend Jay) way back in 2002…and then ran it as a “side-hustle” as grew it into a global business with millions of users world-wide. FutureMe has been featured in many publications (New York Times, Wired, CNN, LA Times, etc…) but my favorite bit of press is <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9261640">an interview that I did with Scott Simon on on Weekend Edition</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://bootstrappers.com/how-a-letter-to-the-future-turned-into-a-life-changing-acquisition/">sold FutureMe in 2021</a> and am now working on a few new ideas and thinking about what I want to do with the rest of my life. Let me know if you have any ideas.</p>

<p>I recently built <a href="https://www.theparentbank">The Parent Bank</a>, which I think is <a href="https://www.theparentbank.com/blog/posts/five-problems-with-a-piggy-bank">much better than a Piggy Bank</a> because (among other features) <a href="https://www.theparentbank.com/blog/posts/you-should-pay-your-kids-a-really-high-interest-rate-on-their-savings-here-s-why-and-how">it allows you to pay your kids a really high interest rate</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve worked at Microsoft (Bing, XBox), Amazon (Alexa) and as an VP of Product at several Boston-area venture-backed startups (<a href="https://www.evertrue.com/">EverTrue</a>, <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/upserve/">Upserve</a> and <a href="https://betterlesson.com/">BetterLesson</a>).</p>

<p>I used to be a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4noKg75z7k4vXJag8">pretty decent basketball player</a> even though my shorts were too small. I was also a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PPsTF9LEoRRYw2TK8">high school basketball coach</a> and took a small charter school without a gym <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/preps/article/Gateway-beats-long-odds-to-reach-NorCal-playoffs-2812135.php">deep into the state play-offs</a>. Now I’m way over the hill, but still enjoy playing hoops, as well as tennis, soccer and riding my bike. Also you should <a href="https://medium.com/@mattsly/shoot-the-two-ed4aaa553294">“shoot the two” when playing “winner’s outs” half-court hoops</a>.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>, where I “played” (um, sat on the bench) on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dAKpFzVJqs&amp;ab_channel=WilliamsEphsSports">really good basketball team</a> that twice went to the Division III Final Four. I also sang in <a href="https://linktr.ee/springstreeters?fbclid=IwAR1ixdaJL-L5-wn0y2HQ8KVnlCNzN5RnJuStgQPA7sYYdZIlIhyYceb5rkc">The Springstreeters</a> with <a href="https://www.williams.edu/feature-stories/leehom-wang-98-wows-williams/">some famous people</a>, and <a href="/2009/07/25/dancing-baby-life-imitating-art.html">crashed the college servers</a> when my first ever web-site went viral.</p>
