        <div class="home"><h1 class="page-heading">Hi, I'm Matt Sly</h1><p>I live in Boston by way of Oakland (and Williamstown, San Francisco, Philadelphia, New Haven and Providence). I enjoy making software, playing sports, hanging out with my family (#girldad x 2!) and exploring the outdoors.</p>

<p>I’ve worked at Microsoft (Bing, XBox), Amazon (Alexa) and as an executive at several Boston-area venture-backed startups: (<a href="https://www.evertrue.com/">EverTrue</a>, <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/upserve/">Upserve</a> and <a href="https://betterlesson.com/">BetterLesson</a>).</p>

<p>I also created <a href="https://www.futureme.org">FutureMe</a> (with my friend Jay) way back in 2002…and then ran it as a “side-hustle” as it grew into a global business with millions of users. FutureMe has been featured in many publications (New York Times, Wired, CNN, LA Times, Oprah(!)…) but my favorite bit of press is <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9261640">an interview that I did with Scott Simon on Weekend Edition</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6877285007862333441/">sold FutureMe in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>I recently built <a href="https://www.theparentbank">The Parent Bank</a> because I decided that <a href="https://www.theparentbank.com/blog/posts/five-problems-with-a-piggy-bank">the piggy bank is due for an upgrade</a> because it doesn’t teach kids about how saving also means earning. I wanted to be able to (among other things) <a href="https://www.theparentbank.com/blog/posts/you-should-pay-your-kids-a-really-high-interest-rate-on-their-savings-here-s-why-and-how">pay my kids a really high interest rate</a> and teach them about the wonders of compounding.</p>

<p>I used to be a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4noKg75z7k4vXJag8">pretty decent basketball player</a> even though my shorts were too small. I also <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PPsTF9LEoRRYw2TK8">coached high school basketball</a> and took a small charter school without a gym <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/preps/article/Gateway-beats-long-odds-to-reach-NorCal-playoffs-2812135.php">deep into the state play-offs</a>. Now I’m way over the hill, but I still enjoy playing hoops, as well as tennis, soccer and cycling. Also you should <a href="https://medium.com/@mattsly/shoot-the-two-ed4aaa553294">“shoot the two” when playing “winner’s outs” half-court hoops</a>.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a>, where I “played” (um, sat on the bench) on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dAKpFzVJqs&amp;ab_channel=WilliamsEphsSports">really good basketball team</a> that twice went to the Division III Final Four. I also sang in <a href="https://linktr.ee/springstreeters?fbclid=IwAR1ixdaJL-L5-wn0y2HQ8KVnlCNzN5RnJuStgQPA7sYYdZIlIhyYceb5rkc">The Springstreeters</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZhzwtEcHU&amp;ab_channel=TIFFTrailers">some famous people</a>, and <a href="/2009/07/25/dancing-baby-life-imitating-art.html">crashed the college servers</a> when my first ever web-site featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_baby">The Dancing Baby</a> went viral.</p>
