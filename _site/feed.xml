&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/famous-dancing-baby-animated.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dancing Baby&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Dancing Baby Jukebox” was a simple web page on my college site (/~msly - remember those tildas?!) that embedded a shockwave player (remember Macromedia?!) and let you pick a song to have the baby dance to. The most popular was James Brown’s “Sex Machine.” (Of note: this was before the big napster controversy and I didn’t even realize what I was doing wasn’t exactly legal and I never got a smackdown from the RIAA…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project went a bit viral (I have no idea how!) and ended up being featured in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/mirapaul/072497mirapaul.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and on NPR and even in the Getty Musuem and the ensuing traffic crashed the college servers. My bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the college &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/DancingBaby-SlyPressRelease.pdf&quot;&gt;press release that is so old school that I had to scan it as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward ten years and indeed it turns out that life imitates art. Here is a video of my daughter when she was 10 months old:&lt;/p&gt;
